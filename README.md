# Naxos

Unity Super Alpha of a game about a girl, a string, and a labyrinth.

## Downloads

Apparently GitHub doesn't support downloading specific folders from a repo. So with that in mind, either grab the whole thing or wait for me to put it up somewhwere and update this readme.

## Current State

This is a super alpha. It's three levels I designed for a game idea I had, but in the course of making the Alpha version, I realized it might not be a very good game.

There are some glitches and performance issues, but more or less this is a complete demo of three levels from a game I originally thought would have no levels.
